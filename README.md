These are the following steps I need to do on the data for data profiling:
1. Identifying Data Quality Issues:
   - Review the dataset to identify potential issues such as missing values, outliers, duplicates, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies.

2. Missing Values:
   - Identify missing values in the dataset and decide how to handle them. This could be done if we had a concrete dataset and could map the data
     - Deleting rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant.
     - Imputing missing values using methods such as mean, median, mode, or more advanced techniques like predictive modeling.

3. Outliers:
   - Identify outliers in the data that deviate significantly from the rest of the observations.
   - Decide whether to remove outliers or transform them using techniques like statistical methods.

4. Duplicates:
   - Identify and remove duplicate records from the dataset to avoid redundancy and ensure data integrity.

5. Standardizing Data Formats:
   - Ensure consistency in data formats across different variables, such as date formats, units of measurement, and categorical values. For example: In the customer table there are alot of errors in the names including special characters and numbers. The data format needs to be predefined and correct data needs to be loaded.

6. Correcting Inconsistencies:
   - Identify and correct inconsistencies in data entry, such as misspellings, different representations of the same category, or inconsistent capitalization. For example: In customer table names are incorrect.

7. Data Transformation:
   - Transform variables as needed, such as converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) or scaling numerical variables for better model performance.

8.Identify Missing Data:
Identify the missing column or data required to build the reports. For example: We need a quantity of products placed by a Customer in the Order table just the order amount won't suffice. 

8. Handling Data Integrity Issues:
   - Check for referential integrity constraints to ensure consistency between related datasets, such as foreign keys in relational databases. For example: In the Shipping table Order ID as foreign key needs to be there to map them with respective orders. We can't identify which order the shipping details are on the table because a customer can have multiple orders.

9. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Conduct EDA to gain insights into the cleaned dataset, understand its distributions, correlations, and other patterns, which may reveal further data quality issues. For Example: Finding the co-relation between Customer, Order and Shipping table.

10. Documenting the Data Cleaning Process:
    - Maintain documentation of the data cleaning steps performed, including any decisions made and their justifications, to ensure reproducibility and transparency. This steps can be used as a part of data cleaning document.

These are the steps followed by me to clean and profile the data.
